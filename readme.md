# Mouse Jiggler

An application that jiggles/moves your mouse by a small distance every 5 seconds.

## Installation
Download the .zip from here. Unzip to get the .exe
<!-- https://github.com/tourist-C/mouse_jiggler/releases/tag/v1.0.0 -->
https://github.com/tourist-C/mouse_jiggler/releases/download/v1.0.0/mouse_jiggler.zip

## Usage
Double click the .exe to start the application.

## Request for Proposal
- Client requested a application that jiggles mouse movement periodically
- OS is unknown, assumed windows
- There is no specific requirement for the movement

## Known Issues
- Antivirus, Chrome browser, Windows security measures attempted to block the delivery and running of the .exe. This is reasonable but makes UX terrible.
